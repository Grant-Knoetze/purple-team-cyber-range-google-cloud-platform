SSH into the instance created:


export instance_id=$(terraform output instance_id)
export project_id=$(terraform output project_id)

gcloud compute ssh ${instance_id} --project ${project_id}
Note that SSH may not work unless your organization user also has access to the newly created project resources.

Cleaning up
First, permanently delete the resources created by Terraform:


terraform destroy
Next, delete the Terraform Admin project and all of its resources:


gcloud projects delete ${TF_ADMIN}
Finally, remove the organization level IAM permissions for the service account:


gcloud organizations remove-iam-policy-binding ${TF_VAR_org_id} \
  --member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator

gcloud organizations remove-iam-policy-binding ${TF_VAR_org_id} \
  --member serviceAccount:terraform@${TF_ADMIN}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/billing.user
